Some features I would miss in Lox:
  - Arrays
  - Types
    - I really like types and they model how I think. Allowing the computer to check my code for errors is a plus to me.
  - Common operators
    - Modulus, bitwise operators
  - Assignment operators
    - +=, *=, etc.
  - Other number types
    - integers, signed and unsigned, different bit counts
